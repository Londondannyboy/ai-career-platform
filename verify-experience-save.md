# âœ… Experience Save Fix

## The Problem
Experience save was failing with a 500 error because the production database was missing the `calculate_profile_completeness` function.

## Quick Fix (Already Applied)
I've commented out the function call in `deepRepoService.ts` lines 252-255.

## To Deploy the Fix
1. Commit and push the changes:
   ```bash
   git add src/lib/profile/deepRepoService.ts
   git commit -m "Fix: Comment out missing profile completeness function"
   git push
   ```

2. Vercel will auto-deploy the fix

## Permanent Solution
After deploying, run the SQL in `fix-production-database.sql` on your Neon database, then uncomment the function calls.

## To Test if it Works
1. Go to https://ai-career-platform.vercel.app/repo/edit
2. Add an experience
3. Click "Save Surface Repository"
4. Refresh the page
5. Check if your experience is still there

The save should now work! ðŸŽ‰
