# Quest Trinity Company Concept - Design Document

**Date**: December 8, 2025  
**Status**: 🔬 CONCEPT EXPLORATION  
**Priority**: Research & Development

## 🎯 Overview

Exploration of extending the Trinity concept from individuals to companies, creating a revolutionary way to visualize and align organizational identity with individual purpose.

## 🏢 Company Trinity vs Personal Trinity

### Personal Trinity (Established)
- **Quest**: "What drives you?" - Personal mission and passion
- **Service**: "How do you serve?" - Skills and contributions
- **Pledge**: "What do you commit to?" - Values and accountability

### Company Trinity (Proposed)
- **Mission**: "Why do we exist?" - Corporate purpose and vision
- **Offerings**: "What do we provide?" - Products, services, value creation
- **Promises**: "How do we operate?" - Values, ethics, commitments

### Alternative Company Structures to Consider
- **Purpose - Impact - Culture**
- **Vision - Execution - Values**
- **Why - What - How** (Simon Sinek model in 3D)

## 🔒 Privacy Architecture

### Visibility Matrix
```
┌─────────────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┬───────────────┐
│ Trinity Type        │ Owner        │ Company      │ Public        │
├─────────────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼───────────────┤
│ Personal Trinity    │ Full Access  │ Hidden*      │ Hidden        │
│ Company Trinity     │ Full Access  │ Full Access  │ Visible       │
│ Alignment Score     │ Visible      │ Visible      │ Optional      │
│ Shared Goals        │ Visible      │ Visible      │ Hidden        │
└─────────────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┴───────────────┘
*Unless explicitly shared by individual
```

### Privacy Principles
1. **Default Privacy**: Personal Trinity is private by default
2. **Explicit Consent**: Sharing requires active user choice
3. **Selective Disclosure**: Users control what aspects to share
4. **No Forced Visibility**: Companies cannot require Trinity sharing

## 🌐 3D OKR Evolution

### Traditional OKRs (2D)
- Linear hierarchy: Objective → Key Results → Tasks
- Time-bound: Quarterly cycles
- Static relationships
- Text-based tracking

### 3D Trinity OKRs
- **Spatial Hierarchy**: Central Trinity core with orbiting objectives
- **Temporal Layers**: Eternal core with time-based outer rings
- **Dynamic Relationships**: Particle flows showing progress
- **Visual Understanding**: See how work connects to purpose

### Visualization Concept
```
         🌟 Trinity Core (Eternal)
        /     |     \
   🪐 Q1 Obj  🪐 Q2 Obj  🪐 Q3 Obj  (Orbiting Quarterly)
   /  |  \    /  |  \    /  |  \
  🌙 🌙 🌙  🌙 🌙 🌙  🌙 🌙 🌙   (Task Moons)
  
  Particles flow: Tasks ➔ Objectives ➔ Trinity
```

## 🤝 Alignment Visualization

### Visual Alignment Indicators
1. **Distance**: Physical space between Trinity cores = alignment gap
2. **Orbital Overlap**: Shared goal spaces = collaboration areas
3. **Color Harmony**: Visual compatibility through color relationships
4. **Particle Bridges**: Active connections and value flows

### Alignment Scoring (Without Revealing Details)
- **High Alignment (80-100%)**: Cores orbit closely, harmonious colors
- **Medium Alignment (50-79%)**: Moderate distance, some shared orbits
- **Low Alignment (0-49%)**: Distant cores, minimal interaction

## 🚀 Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Personal Trinity Viewing (Immediate)
- Connect logged-in user to their own Trinity data
- Admin-only user selector for testing

### Phase 2: Company Trinity Exploration
- Design company Trinity structure
- Create sample company Trinities
- Implement basic visualization

### Phase 3: Alignment System
- Develop privacy-preserving alignment algorithm
- Create visual alignment representations
- Test with sample data

### Phase 4: Full Integration
- Production-ready privacy controls
- Company onboarding flow
- Employee opt-in system

## 💡 Key Innovations

1. **First 3D Identity System**: Moving beyond flat profiles to spatial identity
2. **Privacy-First Design**: Personal data protected by default
3. **Visual Alignment**: See compatibility without compromising privacy
4. **Meaning-Driven Matching**: Connect based on purpose, not keywords

## ❓ Open Questions

1. Is Trinity the right structure for companies, or do we need a different framework?
2. How do we handle multi-level organizations (team/department/company)?
3. Should company Trinity evolve over time like Living Trinity?
4. How do we prevent gaming of alignment scores?

## 📊 Success Metrics

- User control over personal data visibility
- Meaningful alignment scores without privacy breach
- Intuitive understanding of company-person fit
- Adoption by forward-thinking organizations
