## Overview

This document outlines the future development phases for Quest after the current Personal Repo UI sprint. Each phase builds on the previous, creating an increasingly intelligent and valuable platform.

## Phase 2: AI Intelligence Layer (January 2025)

### Objective
Add AI-powered intelligence to categorize, suggest, and enhance user data entry and relationships.

### 2.1 Skill Intelligence

**Technical Implementation**:
```typescript
// Skill embedding and clustering
interface SkillIntelligence {
  generateEmbedding(skill: string): Promise<number[]>;
  findSimilarSkills(skill: string, threshold: number): Promise<string[]>;
  clusterSkills(skills: string[]): Promise<SkillCluster[]>;
  suggestComplementarySkills(currentSkills: string[]): Promise<string[]>;
}
```

**Features**:
- **Semantic Skill Clustering**: Group "Python, Django, Flask" â†’ "Backend Development"
- **Industry Taxonomies**: Map to O*NET, LinkedIn Skills, Indeed categories
- **Skill Suggestions**: "Users with React often have TypeScript"
- **Gap Analysis**: "For Senior Frontend, you're missing: TypeScript, Testing"

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Integrate OpenAI embeddings API
2. Build similarity calculation service
3. Create skill taxonomy database
4. Implement real-time suggestions

### 2.2 Experience Intelligence

**Features**:
- **Implicit Skill Extraction**: Parse job descriptions for hidden skills
- **Achievement Quantification**: Suggest metrics for vague achievements
- **Role Standardization**: Map creative titles to standard roles
- **Career Path Detection**: Identify common progressions

**Example**:
```typescript
// Input: "Managed team and improved sales"
// Output: {
//   skills: ["Team Leadership", "Sales Management", "Revenue Growth"],
//   metrics: ["Team size?", "Sales increase %?", "Timeline?"],
//   standardRole: "Sales Manager"
// }
```

### 2.3 Task & Goal Intelligence

**Features**:
- **Smart Categorization**: Auto-classify tasks by type
- **Time Estimation**: Based on similar historical tasks
- **Dependency Detection**: "This task requires X first"
- **Priority Suggestions**: Based on OKR alignment

### 2.4 Relationship Mapping

**Features**:
- **Cross-Reference Detection**: Auto-link skills to experiences
- **Certification Relevance**: Match certs to career goals
- **Network Effects**: Find users with complementary skills
- **Collaboration Opportunities**: Suggest potential partnerships

## Phase 3: Advanced Visualization (February 2025)

### Objective
Create stunning, informative 3D visualizations that make career data actionable and inspiring.

### 3.1 Career Timeline Visualization

**Concept**: 3D timeline showing past, present, and future

**Features**:
- Past experiences as solid nodes
- Current role highlighted and pulsing
- Future aspirations as translucent goals
- Skill acquisition over time as growing branches
- Certification milestones as badges

**Technical**:
```typescript
interface CareerNode {
  position: { x: number, y: number, z: number };
  timeIndex: Date;
  type: 'experience' | 'education' | 'certification' | 'aspiration';
  opacity: number; // 1.0 for past, 0.5 for future
  connections: string[]; // Skills gained here
}
```

### 3.2 Skills Universe

**Concept**: 3D skill clusters with gravitational relationships

**Features**:
- Core skills as large spheres
- Related skills orbit around cores
- Skill categories as different galaxies
- Connection strength as distance
- Endorsements as sphere size
- Learning paths as bridges between clusters

**Interaction**:
- Click skill to see where it was used
- Drag skills to reorganize
- Zoom into skill galaxy for details
- AI-suggested skills as ghost nodes

### 3.3 OKR Progress Landscape

**Concept**: Topographical map of objectives and progress

**Features**:
- Objectives as mountains to climb
- Key results as waypoints
- Progress as elevation gained
- Deadline urgency as weather effects
- Historical OKRs as conquered peaks

### 3.4 Network Constellation

**Concept**: Professional network as constellations

**Features**:
- You as the north star
- Connections grouped by relationship type
- Shared skills as constellation lines
- Potential connections as dim stars
- Interaction strength as brightness

## Phase 4: Predictive Career Intelligence (March 2025)

### Objective
Use ML to provide career predictions and recommendations.

### 4.1 Career Path Prediction

**Features**:
- **Next Role Prediction**: Based on similar career paths
- **Timeline Estimation**: "Typically takes 2-3 years"
- **Success Factors**: What separates fast progressors
- **Alternative Paths**: "Consider this route instead"

### 4.2 Skill Demand Forecasting

**Features**:
- **Emerging Skills**: What's growing in your field
- **Declining Skills**: What to phase out
- **Investment ROI**: Which skills pay off most
- **Learning Priorities**: Ordered by impact

### 4.3 Opportunity Matching
