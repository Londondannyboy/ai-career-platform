# Data Management Module - Complete Documentation

## üéØ **Project Overview**

**Objective**: Transform from document management to intelligent company repository with AI-powered insights and relationship mapping.

**Achieved**: HarvestAPI-first enrichment platform with smart caching, relationship visualization, and AI-powered querying.

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Evolution**

### **Phase 1: Apollo Integration (Deprecated)**
- **Initial Approach**: Apollo.io People Mix Search API ($20/month plan)
- **Issue Discovered**: Flat employee data without relationships
- **Key Learning**: Apollo provides basic employee data but lacks rich relationship intelligence
- **Status**: Deprecated in favor of HarvestAPI

### **Phase 2: HarvestAPI Integration (Current)**
- **Primary Data Source**: Apify HarvestAPI LinkedIn scraper ($8 per 1,000 profiles)
- **Advantages**: Rich relationship data with recommendations, skills, experience
- **Implementation**: Single source of truth with smart caching
- **Status**: Fully implemented and working

## üîß **Technical Stack**

### **Database: Neon.tech PostgreSQL**
```sql
-- Enhanced company_enrichments table
CREATE TABLE company_enrichments (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
    company_name TEXT UNIQUE,
    normalized_name TEXT,
    canonical_identifier TEXT, -- LinkedIn company URL
    employee_count INTEGER,
    last_enriched TIMESTAMP,
    enrichment_type TEXT, -- 'harvestapi'
    enrichment_data JSONB -- Full employee and relationship data
);
```

### **Caching Strategy**
- **Fresh Cache**: 1 month (was 7 days)
- **Stale Cache**: 3 months
- **Cost Optimization**: Prevents redundant $8 API calls
- **Admin Override**: Force refresh capability

### **API Architecture**
```
/api/enrichment/company - Main enrichment with caching
/api/admin/companies - Company repository management
/api/admin/companies/[id] - Individual company data
/api/admin/intelligent-query - AI-powered natural language queries
/api/debug/database - Database diagnostics
```

## üìä **Data Flow Architecture**

### **HarvestAPI Input Format**
```javascript
{
  currentCompanies: ["https://www.linkedin.com/company/ckdelta/"],
  maxItems: 25,
  profileScraperMode: "Full ($8 per 1k)"
}
```

### **Employee Data Structure**
```javascript
{
  firstName: "Fernando",
  lastName: "Ayuso Palacios", 
  headline: "Director of Data Science and Data Engineering at CKDelta",
  linkedinUrl: "https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernandoayusopalacios",
  about: "Exciting times coming up in my new role...",
  experience: [...], // Work history
  education: [...], // Educational background
  skills: [...], // Skills with endorsements
  receivedRecommendations: [...], // LinkedIn recommendations
  moreProfiles: [...] // Connected profiles
}
```

### **Relationship Processing**
- **Internal Connections**: Map recommendations between employees within same company
- **External Networks**: Identify potential introduction pathways
- **Strength Analysis**: Weight relationships based on recommendation content
- **Network Metrics**: Most connected people, average connections, network density

## üß† **AI Intelligence Layer**

### **Natural Language Query Processing**
- **Intent Analysis**: Sales-focused, technical-focused, executive-focused, networking-focused
- **Search Term Extraction**: Technology, industry, and role-based matching
- **Relevance Scoring**: Multi-factor scoring algorithm
- **Smart Recommendations**: Contact suggestions with reasoning

### **Query Examples**
```
"Find sales people with SaaS experience"
"Who can introduce me to CK Delta's head of engineering?"
"Show me technical leaders with AI/ML background"
"Find experienced fintech professionals"
```

## üìà **Data Visualizations (Built, Pending Deployment)**

### **Skills Heat Maps**

## üîÑ **Data Management Workflow**

### **Enrichment Process**
1. **Input**: Company name or LinkedIn URL
2. **Cache Check**: Look for fresh data (< 1 month)
3. **HarvestAPI Call**: If cache miss or stale
4. **Data Processing**: Transform to standardized format
5. **Relationship Analysis**: Build internal connection graph
6. **Database Storage**: Cache in JSONB format
7. **Visualization**: Generate network graphs and analytics

### **Cost Management**
- **Smart Caching**: Prevents duplicate API calls
- **Admin Controls**: Only admins can force refresh
- **Usage Tracking**: Monitor API call costs
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient company enrichment
