# üö® URGENT: Vercel Environment Variable Fix

## Issue Identified ‚úÖ

The Quest voice functionality is failing because **`NEXT_PUBLIC_HUME_CONFIG_ID` is missing** from the Vercel production environment.

**Debug Results from Production:**
```json
{
  "environment": "production",
  "humeApiKey": "SET",           ‚úÖ
  "humeConfigId": "MISSING",     ‚ùå THIS IS THE PROBLEM
  "humeApiSecret": "SET",        ‚úÖ
  "openaiKey": "SET",           ‚úÖ
  "clerkPublishable": "SET",    ‚úÖ
  "clerkSecret": "SET"          ‚úÖ
}
```

## Immediate Fix Required üîß

### Step 1: Add Missing Environment Variable to Vercel

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Select Project**: `ai-career-platform`
3. **Go to Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
4. **Add the missing variable**:

```
Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_HUME_CONFIG_ID
Value: 8f16326f-a45d-4433-9a12-890120244ec3
Environment: Production
```

### Step 2: Redeploy

After adding the environment variable:
1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click **Redeploy** on the latest deployment
3. Wait for deployment to complete (~2-3 minutes)

### Step 3: Test Voice Functionality

1. Visit: https://ai-career-platform.vercel.app/quest
2. Sign in with proper authentication
3. Click "Start Quest" button
4. Grant microphone permissions when prompted
5. Voice functionality should now work!

## Why This Happened ü§î

The environment variables are properly set in the local `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Working locally ‚úÖ
NEXT_PUBLIC_HUME_API_KEY=cL5dGCBT1EAaAau7eNA84WVfQ3QpS3t2WRZgZvhwYUWhgN0V
NEXT_PUBLIC_HUME_CONFIG_ID=8f16326f-a45d-4433-9a12-890120244ec3  # This one is missing in Vercel
HUME_API_SECRET=fHlJ1vY69ly0dqt3iqZ9XX8PjGyM9OjMkMlBNxXwSaKFgMKG1Sy7hbXqJd0W65i6
```

But `NEXT_PUBLIC_HUME_CONFIG_ID` was never added to the Vercel dashboard, so the production build can't access it.

## Expected Result After Fix üéØ

Once the environment variable is added and redeployed:

1. ‚úÖ **Voice Connection**: Real Hume AI EVI WebSocket connection
2. ‚úÖ **Microphone Access**: Proper permission requests
3. ‚úÖ **Audio Processing**: Real-time voice recording and transmission
4. ‚úÖ **AI Responses**: Voice responses from Hume AI
5. ‚úÖ **Status Updates**: Connection status will show "Connected" instead of "Offline"

## Verification Commands üß™

After the fix, you can verify with:

```bash
# Check environment variables are set
curl -H "x-debug-auth: debug-env-check" https://ai-career-platform.vercel.app/api/debug-env

# Expected result after fix:
# "humeConfigId": "SET" (not "MISSING")
```

**This is a simple environment variable configuration issue, not a code problem. The implementation is correct - it just needs the missing config ID in production!** üöÄ
