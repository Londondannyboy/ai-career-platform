â”œâ”€â”€ User Knowledge Graph (Neo4j + Graphiti) 
â”œâ”€â”€ Company Intelligence (Neon PostgreSQL + pgvector)
â”œâ”€â”€ Industry Data (Time-series + Structured Facts)  
â”œâ”€â”€ Live Web Intelligence (MCP Browser)
â””â”€â”€ Repository Analysis (AST + Code Intelligence)
```

### 2.2 Hybrid Data Architecture

#### Supabase - Primary Application Database
```sql
-- Core application data with authentication and real-time features
users (id, email, created_at, subscription_tier, preferences)
user_profiles (user_id, linkedin_data, manual_profile_data, privacy_settings)
conversations (id, user_id, transcript, ai_responses, session_metadata)
coaching_sessions (id, user_id, duration, insights, follow_up_actions)
repositories (id, user_id, github_url, analysis_status, last_analyzed)
```

**Supabase Advantages:**
- **Authentication & Authorization** - Built-in user management with Clerk integration
- **Real-time Subscriptions** - Live updates for coaching sessions and notifications

## **ðŸŒŸ DataMagnet: Enterprise Intelligence Game-Changer**

### The Enterprise B2B Problem
Large enterprises with **opaque, multifaceted organizational structures** create impossible sales scenarios:
- **Geographic Distribution:** "Hey Bill, I know Pete" doesn't work when Pete is in Singapore and you're in London
- **Complex Hierarchies:** 50,000+ employee companies with unclear reporting structures  
- **Department Silos:** Engineering, Sales, Product teams that never interact
- **Decision Maker Mystery:** Who actually approves the $2M software purchase?

### DataMagnet's Unique Solution
**LinkedIn Recommendation Context = Authentic Relationship Validation**

```json
{
  "recommendation": {
    "name": "Jim Newton",
    "context": "Jim was senior to Philip but didn't manage Philip directly", 
    "description": "Phil brought enormous commercial drive...",
    "relationship_confidence": 95
  }
}
```

**Key Advantages over Traditional Scrapers:**
- **Verified Relationships:** LinkedIn-authenticated recommendation context
- **Network Clusters:** "Also viewed" profiles reveal tight company networks  
- **Anti-Gaming Protection:** Can't fake LinkedIn recommendations
- **Relationship Types:** Manager/direct report/peer/client relationships
- **Cross-Company Mapping:** Track career movements and network evolution

### Enterprise Use Cases

#### 1. **Account Penetration Strategy**

```

#### 2. **Decision Maker Mapping** 
```
Challenge: Who approves AI budget at Fortune 500 company?
DataMagnet shows: CTO â†’ VP Engineering â†’ Director AI â†’ Sarah (Product Manager)
Plus: All recommendation relationships validate this hierarchy
```

#### 3. **Competitive Intelligence**
```
Track: Key talent movement from Competitor A to Target Company B
Insight: Former Competitor A team now clustered in Target Company B
Opportunity: They know pain points we solve
```

  switch (queryType) {
    case 'user_profile_data':
      // Real-time user information, preferences, coaching history
      return await supabaseQuery(query, userContext);
    
    case 'semantic_search':
      // Find similar profiles, companies, opportunities
      return await neonVectorSearch(query, userContext);
    
    case 'relationship_analysis':
      // Network connections, career paths, company relationships
      return await rushDBGraphTraversal(query, userContext);

## 10. Visual Identity & Brand Strategy

### 10.1 Domain Architecture

#### Primary Business Domain
- **quest.app** - Used for:
  - Email addresses (dan@quest.app)
  - Business cards and professional materials
  - API endpoints and technical infrastructure
  - SEO and discoverability
  - Customer support and communications

#### Application Domain  
- **quÃ«.st** - The actual application URL
  - Creates exclusivity and intrigue
  - Technical users appreciate the uniqueness
  - Punycode (xn--qu-ija.st) serves as "secret entrance"
  - Reinforces the "quest" narrative - you must seek it out

### 10.2 Visual Identity System

#### The Diaeresis as Design Element
- **The Two Dots (Ã«)** represent:
  - Nodes in a network
  - Connection points
  - Eyes watching/observing
  - Points on a journey
  - Dual identity (who you were/who you're becoming)

#### Logo & Typography
- **Primary Mark**: Lowercase "quÃ«.st" with custom typography
- **Secondary Mark**: The two dots alone as minimal identifier
- **Typography**: Clean, minimal, Scandinavian-inspired
- **Color**: Dots can pulse, connect, change color based on context

#### Animation Language
- **Loading States**: Two dots finding each other and connecting
- **Transitions**: Dots forming constellations and networks
- **Success States**: Dots pulsing in celebration
- **Network Visualization**: Connections forming the Ã« pattern
- **User Avatars**: Subtle dot patterns in profile imagery

### 10.3 Launch Strategy: The Review Committee

#### Invite-Only Onboarding Flow

##### Phase 1: Application
- User applies to join Quest
- Basic information collected
- Immediate response: "Your application has been submitted for review"

##### Phase 2: Strategic Rejection
- After 24-48 hours: "Your application to Quest is under review by our community committee"
- Message emphasizes exclusivity and quality
- Creates anticipation and desire

##### Phase 3: Profile Enrichment (Behind the Scenes)
- Run LinkedIn scrapers
- Enrich company data
- Prepare personalized onboarding
- Manual review if needed
- Build initial network connections

##### Phase 4: Community Acceptance
- After 3-7 days: "Congratulations! Your application has been approved"
- "Members Sarah Chen and Michael Rodriguez vouched for your application"
- Personalized welcome with pre-populated data
- Immediate value demonstration

#### Benefits of Review Committee Strategy

##### Operational
- **Time to prepare**: Enrich profiles, fix bugs, personalize experience
- **Quality control**: Ensure each user has optimal first experience  
- **Load management**: Control growth rate to maintain quality
- **Data enrichment**: Pre-populate profiles for instant value

##### Psychological  
- **Exclusivity**: Not everyone gets in immediately
- **Social proof**: Being vouched for creates belonging
- **Investment**: Users value what they worked to obtain
- **Community**: Early users feel like insiders

##### Strategic
- **Network effects**: Each acceptance strengthens the network
- **Word of mouth**: Rejection/acceptance creates conversation
- **Quality over quantity**: Better 100 engaged users than 10,000 casual ones
- **Feedback loop**: Early users provide valuable input

### 10.4 Implementation Priorities

#### Immediate (Phase 0)
1. Secure quest.app domain for business operations
2. Configure quÃ«.st for application access
3. Design initial visual identity guide
4. Build review committee onboarding flow

#### Short-term (Phase 1)

3. Design community vouching system
4. Build personalized onboarding

#### Medium-term (Phase 2)
