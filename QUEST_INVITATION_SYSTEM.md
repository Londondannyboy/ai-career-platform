# Quest Invitation System

## Overview

Quest's invitation system transforms networking from transactional to transformational. Instead of generic "connect" requests, Quest creates rich, contextual invitations that demonstrate genuine understanding of the invitee and their professional journey.

## Core Philosophy

### The Problem with Traditional Networking
- Generic connection requests
- No context or personal investment
- Transactional relationship building
- Overwhelming volume, minimal value

### The Quest Solution
- Thoughtful, researched invitations
- Rich context from personal knowledge
- Investment in invitee's success
- Quality over quantity approach
