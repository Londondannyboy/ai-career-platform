# Deep Repo Privacy Architecture

## Overview

Quest's privacy architecture is built on a fundamental principle: truth requires safety. The Deep Repo system creates secure layers of personal information, ensuring members can be honest about their professional journey without fear of judgment or exposure.

## The Four-Layer Repository System

### 1. Deep Repo (Private/Encrypted)
**Purpose**: Raw truth and founding statements
**Access**: User only, encrypted storage
**Contents**:
- Trinity declarations (Quest, Service, Pledge)
- Unfiltered personal reflections
- Private fears and motivations
- Authentic self-assessment

**Examples**:
- Quest: "Prove I'm more than dad's disappointment"
- Service: "My family's financial security"
- Pledge: "To stop sabotaging myself"

### 2. Personal Repo (Private/User + AI)
**Purpose**: Working goals and development areas
**Access**: User + AI coach only
**Contents**:
- Processed professional objectives
- Skill development plans
- Career milestone tracking
- Growth areas and challenges

**Examples**:
- Quest: "Become marketing manager by 2028"
- Service: "My team's professional growth"
- Pledge: "To seek feedback actively"

### 3. Working Repo (Coach Accessible)
**Purpose**: Active coaching and development focus
**Access**: User + AI coach + human coaches (if engaged)
**Contents**:
- Current learning objectives
- Coaching conversation history
- Actionable development plans
- Performance tracking

**Examples**:
- Quest: "Develop strategic marketing skills"
- Service: "My organization's growth"
- Pledge: "To communicate with clarity"

### 4. Surface Repo (Public)
**Purpose**: Professional networking presence
**Access**: Network members, recruiters, public
**Contents**:
- Professional bio and achievements
- Polished objective statements
- Public portfolio items
- Network connection points

**Examples**:
- Quest: "Growth Marketing Leader"
- Service: "Scaling high-impact organizations"
- Pledge: "Innovation through collaboration"

## Privacy Guarantees

### Deep Repo Protection (Absolute)
- **AES-256 encryption** at rest and in transit
- **Zero-knowledge architecture** - Quest cannot read content without user key
- **No AI training data** - Never used for model training
- **No analytics tracking** - Excluded from all data analysis
- **No sharing mechanism** - No API endpoints for access
- **Audit logging** - All access attempts logged for security

### Personal Repo Protection (User + AI)
- **Encrypted storage** with user-specific keys
- **AI coach only** - Specified AI coaching functions only
- **No human review** unless user explicitly requests
- **No model training** without explicit consent
- **Session-based access** - AI forgets between sessions unless user permits memory

### Working Repo Protection (Coaching Context)
- **Role-based access** - Only designated coaches
- **Consent-based sharing** - User approves each access level
- **Audit trail** - Who accessed what and when
- **Time-limited access** - Coach permissions expire
- **Right to revoke** - User can remove access anytime

### Surface Repo (Controlled Public)
- **User-curated content** - Only what they choose to share
- **Privacy controls** - Visibility settings per item
- **Connection gating** - Control who can see what
- **Professional focus** - No personal life bleed

## Data Governance Framework

### User Rights (Absolute)
- **Right to View**: See all their data across all repos
- **Right to Edit**: Modify Personal, Working, and Surface repos
- **Right to Migrate**: Move data between appropriate layers
- **Right to Delete**: Remove data or entire account
- **Right to Export**: Download all data in standard formats
- **Right to Audit**: See who accessed what and when

### User Controls (Granular)
```typescript
interface PrivacySettings {
  deep_repo: {
    ai_learning: boolean           // Default: false
    emergency_access: boolean      // Default: false
    backup_recovery: boolean       // Default: true
  }
  personal_repo: {
    ai_memory: boolean            // Default: false
    session_persistence: boolean  // Default: false
    analytics_inclusion: boolean  // Default: false
  }
  working_repo: {
    coach_access: string[]        // Approved coach IDs
    retention_period: number      // Days to keep data
    sharing_permissions: object   // What coaches can see
  }
  surface_repo: {
    visibility: 'network' | 'public' | 'connections'
    searchable: boolean
    profile_completeness: 'full' | 'partial' | 'minimal'
  }
}
```

### Data Flow Rules

#### Upward Migration (More Private → Less Private)
- **User Control Only**: Only user can move data up layers
- **Explicit Consent**: Each migration requires confirmation
- **Edit Before Share**: User can modify before migration
- **Audit Trail**: Track what was shared when

#### Downward Protection (Less Private → More Private)
- **Automatic Protection**: More private data never leaks down
- **System Enforcement**: Technical barriers prevent exposure
- **Coach Barriers**: Coaches cannot access higher privacy layers
- **AI Boundaries**: AI respects data boundaries absolutely

## Technical Implementation

### Encryption Strategy
```typescript
interface RepoSecurity {
  deep_repo: {
    encryption: 'AES-256-GCM'
    key_derivation: 'PBKDF2'

  }
  personal_repo: {
    encryption: 'AES-256-GCM'
    key_management: 'user_derived'
    ai_access_token: 'session_only'
  }
  working_repo: {
    encryption: 'AES-256-GCM'
    role_based_keys: true
    access_logging: 'comprehensive'
  }
  surface_repo: {
    encryption: 'AES-256-GCM'
    public_key_sharing: true
    privacy_controls: 'granular'
  }
}
```

### Access Control
```typescript
interface AccessControl {
  authentication: {
    multi_factor: 'required'
    biometric_option: 'available'
    session_timeout: 'configurable'
  }
  authorization: {
    role_based: true
