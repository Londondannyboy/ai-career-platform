# Quest Development Principles & Code Quality

This document outlines the core development principles and code quality standards for the Quest Trinity System.

## Core Development Principles

Quest follows these non-negotiable principles to maintain code quality and development efficiency:

### **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
- **Zero Active Code Duplication** - Each functionality exists in exactly one place in production code
- **Single Source of Truth** - One authoritative implementation per feature
- **Documentation Exception** - Historical documentation may reference similar implementations for learning purposes
- **Example**: One voice integration system (`QUEST_HUME_EVI_SUCCESS_DOCUMENTATION.md`), not multiple competing approaches

### **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**
- **Simplest Solution That Works** - Implement the most straightforward approach first
- **No Over-Engineering** - Avoid unnecessary complexity until proven needed
- **Innovation Balance** - Quest's revolutionary features require sophisticated architecture, but each component should be as simple as possible
- **Example**: Native HTML components over complex UI libraries where possible

### **Clean File System (Modified for Quest)**
- **Active Files Only** - All files in main directory must be actively used or clearly documented as archives
- **Preserve Successful Deployments** - Keep records of working implementations for iteration reference
- **Clear Organization** - Logical file structure with consistent naming (QUEST_ prefix)
- **Archive Legacy** - Move outdated files to `/archive/` rather than deletion
- **Rationale**: Quest's deployment history provides valuable iteration insights

### **Transparent Error Handling**
- **No Error Hiding** - All errors must be properly displayed to users
- **No Silent Fallbacks** - Fallback mechanisms that mask issues are prohibited
- **Clear Error Messages** - Errors must be actionable and honest
- **Production Stability** - Errors should guide users to solutions, not hide problems

## Success Criteria for Quest Features

All Quest implementations must meet these standards:

### **Zero Active Duplication**
- ✅ No duplicate code in production paths
- ✅ Single implementation per feature
- ✅ Clear delineation between current and archived approaches

### **Complete Functionality**
- ✅ All features work correctly in production
- ✅ Full TypeScript compilation without errors
- ✅ All API endpoints return proper responses

### **Transparent Operations**
- ✅ All errors displayed to users with clear messaging
- ✅ No hidden failures or silent fallbacks
- ✅ Real-time status indicators for long operations

### **Clean Architecture**
- ✅ External CSS and JavaScript files (no inline styles/scripts)
- ✅ Reusable, modular components
- ✅ Consistent file organization with QUEST_ naming
- ✅ Complete documentation for all implementations

### **Production Ready**
- ✅ Build process completes without errors (`npm run build`)
- ✅ All environment variables properly configured
- ✅ Working deployment on Vercel with HTTPS
- ✅ Database connections and API integrations functional

## Quest-Specific Development Guidelines

### **Innovation vs. Simplicity Balance**
- Quest's revolutionary Trinity system requires sophisticated AI architecture
- **Keep complex systems modular** - Each component (voice, graph, web intelligence) is independently testable
- **Simple interfaces** to complex systems - User-facing components remain intuitive
- **Document complexity** - Advanced features must have clear implementation guides

### **Historical Value Preservation**
- **Keep deployment milestones** - Successful implementations serve as reference points
- **Document iteration reasons** - Why changes were made, not just what changed
- **Archive, don't delete** - Failed approaches provide learning value
- **Example**: Hume voice integration attempts show evolution to current success

### **Voice AI Specific**
- **Audio format requirements** are non-negotiable (16-bit PCM)
- **CLM endpoint format** must match OpenAI specification exactly
- **Error handling** is critical for production voice interactions
- **No fallback audio** - Voice failures must be clearly communicated

### **Database Architecture**
- **Multi-database consistency** - Neon + Neo4j + Graphiti must stay synchronized
- **No data duplication** across databases - each has specific role
- **Clear data flow** - Document which database handles which operations
- **Backup strategies** - All databases must have recovery plans

## Implementation Checklist

Before considering any Quest feature complete:

- [ ] **Code Quality**: No duplication, simple implementation, external assets
- [ ] **Error Handling**: All errors displayed, no silent failures
- [ ] **Testing**: Feature works in production environment
- [ ] **Documentation**: Implementation guide created with QUEST_ prefix
- [ ] **File Organization**: All files used or properly archived
- [ ] **Integration**: Works with existing Quest architecture
- [ ] **User Experience**: Error states guide users to resolution

## TypeScript Standards

### Required Type Safety
```typescript
// Always type function parameters
function processData(data: TrinityData): ProcessedResult

// Type array methods
items.map((item: ItemType, index: number) => ...)

// Use interfaces for complex objects
interface UserProfile {
  id: string;
  trinity: TrinityStatement;
  repos: RepoLayers;
}
```

### Avoid Any Types
```typescript
// WRONG
const data: any = fetchData();

// CORRECT
const data: UserData | null = fetchData();
```

## API Design Standards

### RESTful Conventions
- GET: Read operations only
- POST: Create new resources
- PUT/PATCH: Update existing resources
- DELETE: Remove resources

### Response Format
```typescript
// Success
return NextResponse.json({
  success: true,
  data: result,
  message: 'Operation completed'
});

// Error
return NextResponse.json({
  error: 'Clear error message',
  details: 'Helpful context',
  suggestion: 'How to fix'
}, { status: 400 });
```

## Component Architecture

### Separation of Concerns
- **Pages**: Route handling and data fetching
- **Components**: Reusable UI elements
- **Hooks**: Shared logic and state management
- **Services**: Business logic and API calls
- **Utils**: Pure utility functions

### Naming Conventions
- **Files**: `camelCase.ts` or `PascalCase.tsx`
- **Components**: `PascalCase`
- **Functions**: `camelCase`
- **Constants**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- **Interfaces**: `PascalCase` with descriptive names

## Documentation Standards

### File Naming
- All project documentation: `QUEST_[DESCRIPTIVE_NAME].md`
- Exception: `CLAUDE.md` for AI integration
- Session summaries: `QUEST_SESSION_SUMMARY_[TOPIC].md`

### Code Comments
- Explain "why" not "what"
- Document complex algorithms
- Note any workarounds with reasons
- Reference related documentation

## Performance Guidelines

### Frontend Optimization
- Dynamic imports for heavy libraries
- Image optimization with Next.js Image
- Minimize bundle size
- Progressive enhancement

### Backend Optimization
- Efficient database queries
- Proper indexing
- Connection pooling
- Response caching where appropriate

## Security Standards

### API Security
- Validate all inputs
- Sanitize user data
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement rate limiting

### Authentication
- Clerk middleware for protected routes
- Proper session management
- Secure cookie settings
- HTTPS only in production
