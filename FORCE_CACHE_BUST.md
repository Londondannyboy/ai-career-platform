# Force Cache Bust - Environment Variable Debug

**Timestamp:** 2025-06-29 12:19:00
**Issue:** NEXT_PUBLIC_HUME_CONFIG_ID not accessible in production despite being set in Vercel dashboard
**Action:** Aggressive debugging and cache busting

## Changes Made:
1. Added detailed environment variable debugging to useHumeEVI hook
2. Created direct environment variable test endpoint: /api/env-debug-direct  
3. Force deployment with timestamp to bust any caches

## Debug Information:
- Environment variable IS in Vercel dashboard (confirmed by screenshot)
- Variable shows as configured for Production, Preview, and Development
- But process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_HUME_CONFIG_ID returns undefined in production runtime

## Test Endpoints After Deployment:
- `/api/env-debug-direct` - Direct environment variable access test
- `/api/debug-env-detailed` - Comprehensive environment analysis

This deployment should provide definitive debugging information about why the environment variable is not accessible.
