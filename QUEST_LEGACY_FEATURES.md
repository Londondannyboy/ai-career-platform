# Quest Legacy Features

This document contains features that remain in the codebase but are no longer primary focus areas.

## Previous Focus Areas

The following features were explored or partially implemented but have been de-prioritized in favor of the Trinity-centric approach:

### 3D Graph Database Visualization
- **Status**: Replaced by Trinity sacred geometry visualization
- **Original Intent**: Visualize database relationships in 3D
- **Current State**: Code remains but focus shifted to Trinity visualization
- **Files**: Various graph visualization components

### Synthetic Intelligence Foundation
- **Status**: Replaced by Trinity-based networking
- **Original Intent**: AI-generated professional profiles
- **Current State**: Evolved into personalized Trinity statements
- **Integration**: May resurface for enterprise features

### Repository Analysis
- **Status**: Potential Trinity integration for technical professionals
- **Original Intent**: Analyze GitHub repositories for skills
- **Current State**: Could enhance technical Trinity statements
- **Future**: May integrate with developer-focused features

### Basic Text Coaching
- **Status**: Replaced by voice-first Trinity experience
- **Original Intent**: Simple text-based coaching interface
- **Current State**: Evolved into Hume EVI voice integration
- **Legacy**: Original coaching prompts inform voice interactions

## Evolution Pattern

These features demonstrate Quest's evolution:
1. Started with technical/analytical focus
2. Evolved toward human-centered identity (Trinity)
3. Shifted from text to voice-first interactions
4. Moved from data visualization to identity visualization

## Potential Resurrections

Some legacy features may return in evolved forms:
- **Repository Analysis** → Technical Trinity enhancements
- **Synthetic Intelligence** → Enterprise team optimization
- **Graph Visualization** → Network relationship mapping
- **Text Coaching** → Accessibility fallback option

## Code Preservation

Legacy code is preserved because:
- Historical context for development decisions
- Potential future integration points
- Learning from past implementations
- Avoiding repeated exploration of dead ends
