### üí° Project Summary

Quest has evolved from a simple profile system to a comprehensive career intelligence platform. The recent sprint focused on data enrichment, moving from basic strings to rich, structured data objects that capture the nuance of professional development.

**Key Innovations:**
- **Rich Data Objects**: Experiences now include impact metrics, team sizes, and methodologies
- **AI Intelligence**: Skills are connected through relationships, prerequisites, and learning paths
- **Career Guidance**: Personalized recommendations based on trajectory analysis
- **Visual Intelligence**: 3D graphs showing skill relationships and career paths

**Technical Architecture:**
- 434 source files with 94,611 lines of TypeScript/React code
- Modular component structure with dynamic imports
- PostgreSQL with JSONB for flexible schemas
- AI-powered analysis using GPT-4
- 3D visualizations using react-force-graph-3d

**Next Phase Focus:**
- Gap analysis between current state and goals
- Achievement impact scoring
- Social features (endorsements)
- Automated insights and progress tracking

The platform now provides intelligent career guidance by understanding not just what skills users have, but how they relate, how to acquire new ones, and what career paths are available based on their unique trajectory.
