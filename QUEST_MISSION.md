# Quest Mission Statement

## Core Mission

**"LinkedIn shows who you were. Quest shows who you're becoming."**

Quest empowers professionals to define and achieve their future identity, not just document their past. We believe your greatest accomplishments are ahead of you.

## Philosophy

### Person-Centric, Not Company-Centric
Quest is fundamentally about individual professional identity and growth. While companies have goals, Quest focuses on the person's journey, aspirations, and evolution.

### Future-Focused Professional Identity
Traditional professional networks are résumé repositories - backward-looking archives of past accomplishments. Quest is different:
- We start with who you want to become
- We build pathways to get there
- We measure progress toward your future self
- We celebrate the journey, not just arrivals

### Safe Space for Audacious Goals
Everyone deserves a private space to dream big:
- Your future aspirations live in Personal Repo (private by default)
- Share selectively with coaches, mentors, or accountability partners
- No public embarrassment for ambitious goals
- Iterate as your vision evolves

## Key Differentiators

### 1. Trinity Identity System
Three eternal questions that define professional identity:
- **Quest**: What drives you?
- **Service**: How do you serve?
- **Pledge**: What do you commit to?

### 2. Four-Layer Privacy Architecture
Control what the world sees:
- **Surface**: Public professional profile
- **Working**: Curated achievements for opportunities
- **Personal**: Private goals, OKRs, and aspirations
- **Deep**: Core identity and values (Trinity)

### 3. AI-Powered Growth Coach
- Knows your aspirations and current state
- Provides personalized guidance
- Tracks progress without judgment
- Evolves with your journey

### 4. Future Experience Declarations
Revolutionary feature allowing users to define:
- Target roles and timeline
- Companies or company types they aspire to join
- Educational goals and certifications planned
- Milestones to achieve these aspirations

## Design Principles

### 1. Privacy First
Your aspirations are yours. Default to private, share by choice.

### 2. Growth Mindset
Everyone is capable of transformation. Quest provides the tools and support.

### 3. Authentic Progress
Real growth over vanity metrics. Honest self-assessment over public posturing.

### 4. Individual Empowerment
You own your data, your journey, and your future.

## What Quest Is NOT

- **Not a job board**: Though opportunities may find you
- **Not a company OKR system**: Personal goals, not corporate metrics  
- **Not a task manager**: Strategic growth, not daily todos
- **Not LinkedIn 2.0**: Future-focused, not résumé-focused

## Our Commitment

Quest commits to:
1. Always prioritize individual growth over corporate interests
2. Maintain privacy as a fundamental right, not a premium feature
3. Use AI to empower, not manipulate or exploit
4. Build for the professional you're becoming, not the one you were
